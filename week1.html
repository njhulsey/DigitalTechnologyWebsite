				<p class = "lead">Our first challenge was to build a tower to hold a marshmellow and whoever had the tallest tower won. We started off with the idea of of making a pyramid, but decided on making a prism because it would allow for a stronger base. Towards the top of the tower we had the four corners meet in the center, creating a prism-like structure. We doubled the spaghetti noodles making them able to hold the marshmellow's weight. We actually ended up winning by having the tallest tower.</p>

		<h1>Challenge 2</h1>

				<p class = "lead">Our second challenge was to build a ramp to move a marble: whoever made the marble travel the longest won. At first we wanted to build a long ramp at the end of the table, but ended up changing our design well over the half way point. The new design was a really steep ramp that just free shot the marble into a basket, however the tower was too tall and wasn't stable enough to hold the marble. I think changing our design was why we failed, it was thought out enough.</p>

				<p class = "lead">Welcome to my website! I already have a little bit out background knowledge on webdesign because my brother taught me what he learned in college. This website is built with bootstrap so it is completely fluid. If you resize this website it will adjust itself accordingly. However, the design itself of this website is not the best since my artistic ability is lacking.</p>
