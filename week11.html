				<p class="lead">This week we built the adafruit bluetooth car. I had fun building this kit and when I was done I was able to help out other kids with their cars. Most of the issues that were occuring was because the laptops did not have the adafruit drives installed. This kit aimed to teach kids about the connection between their smartphones and electronics</p>
