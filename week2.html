				<p class = "lead">Creating the fume extractor was one of my favorite things we've done so far. I used calipers to get my measurements and took a lot of inspiration from the adafruit fume extractor. The fan sits at the top of the case and has the battery and switch at the bottom. I used fusion 360 for the first time with this project and found it easier to use than solidworks. After printing, I went to ace hardware and bought some screws to use. They didn't really fit but drilling them in seemed to be fine. I then got a switch from Mr. Blankenship and used that to turn on and off the fan. The only flaw in my design was that I forgot to elevate the foam away from the blades in the case.</p>
