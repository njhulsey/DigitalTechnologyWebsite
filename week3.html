				<p class = "lead">Making my puzzle was much more fun than I had anticipated. At first, I did not know what image I wanted to use for my puzzle, but ultimately decided on using one of my brother's photos he took while in Florence. I printed the image onto a 12" x 12" piece of cardboard (one side was white) using a UV printer. The UV printer was relatively easy to use and I did not have any trouble setting it up. The quality was amazing and I really enjoyed using it. The next step after that was cutting. I had to design the the pattern because I wanted a 6x6 puzzle. This process was harder than I expected it to be. First, I used fusion 360 to make the basic grid and the first puzzle piece. Then I saved that as a .dxf file and opened it in CorelDraw which allowed me to easily manipulate the arcs. After I was done in CorelDraw I opened fusion 360 back up and deleted the grid lines and remade them in between the arcs. At the end, I'm pretty sure there was an easier way to go about it. Down below are pictures of the design and the final product</p>

		<h1>T-Shirt</h1>

				<p class = "lead">At first I had no idea for a t-shirt, and since I am not artistic, I decided to put some code on a t-shirt that would produce art if compiled. I used photoshop to type the code then saved it and opened it in the printer software. Honestly, I thought the tshirt machine was going to be more complicated to use, but it was really simple. There's actually an error in my code.....</p>
