		<h1>Coaster</h1>
		<hr>

		<p class = "lead">This week we had to design either a box or a coaster. Since I had already made a box in Mr. Gerber's echoe, I had to make a coaster. At first I was not particularly in a coaster since I did not have any ideas for one, so I decided to make one for my father. I made a design on CorelDraw with his name and two beers facing eachother. When printing the coaster, I mixed up the speed and power numbers and had to start over. After that though it turned out great! <br> <br> Also, before I began cutting I helped Andrew McCaffrey with his cut. He was trying to engrave an image but the laser cutter was not engraving part of it. I helped him by changing the image to be more monochromatic which seemed to solve the problem.</p>
