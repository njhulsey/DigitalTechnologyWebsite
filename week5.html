				<p class = "lead">This week I made multi-colored stickers, since I had already made stickers in Mr. Gerber's echoe. I started by taking a picture of the Google G from the internet and loading it into CorelDraw. Once there, I traced the bitmap as a logo and then ungrouped the individual pieces. I then cut out the pieces in their respected colors. This took awhile since I had to change out the colors for each piece. Once that was done I then assembled the logo and covered it with transfer tape. I did notice however, when I was putting the sticker on my laptop it was not transfering well. I also made an android sticker because I am a total nerd. </p>
