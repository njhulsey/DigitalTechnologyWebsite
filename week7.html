				<p class = "lead">I chose to make my pendant by using the laser cutter. I traced the tesla logo from an image and engraved it on one block.  I rastered more than once to increase the depth (or height) on the pendent. I then took another block of wood and engraved "tesla" on it. However, I had to flip "tesla" because when I case it will become a mirror of itself. Once I had both sides sone, I made the middle piece by cutting a whole in the center, a sprue, and vents. The really trinking thing is making sure that all the pieces are aligned when pouring. I cannot wait to pour the mold</p>

		<h1>Android Chocolate</h1>		
		<hr>

		<div class = "row">
			<div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
				<p class = "lead">For the chocolate mold I made the android robot.  I quickly modeled it on the computer and cut it out on the milling machine. Mr. Gerber setup the machine and poured the negative mold since I was out of class. On the last day of class we poured chocolate into the negative molds. I did not let my chocolate sit long enough to completely harden, so when I took it out his stomach was still liquid. Nevertheless it was super delicious and I had a total blast making it.</p>
