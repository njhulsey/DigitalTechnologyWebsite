					<p class = "lead">This week we were able to learn how to solder by putting together some soldering kits. I chose the LED clock which wasn't too hard to put together. It was really fun doing and use it today as an alarm clock. It can tell temperature, keep the time when its not plugged in, beep, and change the light depending on the brightness in the room. It also has a ring of LEDs which is just for fancy patterns.</p>
